        If you're seeing this, it means Parcel has successfully compiled and opened your workspace.

        You're probably going to want to head to <kbd>/labs/lab-01</kbd> or similar to get started.

    <p class="warning">
        Because of a limitation of Parcel, this index page doubles as the 404 page for your
        workspace. If you were expecting to see a different page, double check your URL!
